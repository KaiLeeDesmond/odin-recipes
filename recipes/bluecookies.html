                Brown Butter and Blue Chocolate Chip Cookies may sound good on paper, but it won't taste as good.

            <li>Next, add 1 whole egg and 1 egg yolk to the wet mix and mix until combined.</li>
            <li>Add the vanilla extract and the desired amount of blue food coloring until the blue is uniform throughout the wet mix.</li>

            <li>Add the milk chocolate chips and the white chocolate chips to the dough and fold.</li>
            <li>Pat out some dough into a big ball and some Hershey's chocolate in the center.</li>
            <li>Allow the dough balls to chill for four hours.</li>
